        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lemonade is a sweetened lemon-flavored drink.</p>
        <p>The predominant form of lemonade found in the US, Canada, and India,
        cloudy lemonade, also known as traditional or old fashioned lemonade in
        the UK and Australia, is non-carbonated and made with fresh lemon juice;
        however, commercially produced varieties are also available. Generally
        served cold,</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>450 g (2 cups) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 lemons</li>
            <li>Still or sparkling water (to dilute)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure the sugar into a pan and add 500ml (2 cups) water.</li>
            <li>Heat gently, stirring often, until the sugar is just dissolved. Turn off the heat and leave to cool.</li>
            <li>Juice and zest the lemons taking care not to remove any of the bitter white pith. Remove the pips from the juice.</li>
            <li>Put the zest and juice into a blender or a bowl in which you can use a stick blender. Add 250ml of the cooled sugar syrup and blend for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place a sieve over a bowl, line with a piece of muslin or a clean tea towel and strain the liquid. Give the muslin a good squeeze then discard it and the zest.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining sugar syrup to the lemonade and transfer it to a storage bottle.</li>
            <li>Store in the fridge for up to a few days if it lasts that long.</li>
            <li>To serve, let down 1 part lemonade to 3-4 parts flat or sparkling water.</li>
        </ol>
