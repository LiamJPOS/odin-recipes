        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Revani is a sweet, syrup-soaked semolina cake that originated in
        Egypt. The semolina batter is baked in a sheet pan, then sweetened with
        orange flower water, rose water or simple syrup, and typically cut into
        diamond shapes or squares.</p> 
        <p>The dish has also spread within most areas of the former Ottoman Empire.</p>
